# SuppliesAndDemand
## Inspiration
We were inspired by the millions of people all over the world that do not have enough to eat, or do not have access to drinking water. These people suffer through a lot on a daily basis, and we wanted to make their lives a little better. We were also inspired by the many selfless people(angels) out there that we know would make donations and help others if there was an easy way to do it, so we created Supplies and Demand.

## What it does
With Supplies and Demand, anyone can fill out a request form requesting supplies, and detail how much they need, and input their location. Anyone that wants to donate to this cause can easily fill out a provider form, where they also input their location, how many supplies they can give, and if they can ship their supplies or not. Then, the AI will generate a match, based on location(unless the provider can ship), and supply amount needed/available. The provider can then view basic info(like the city the requester lives in, and the amounts of supplies needed), then choose to accept or decline this match, and the AI will give new matches until the provider accepts one. After accepting the match, the provider will be able to view full information, and emails will be sent out to both the provider and the receiver. Then, the provider will receive virtual points for their account for their good deeds. With this format, anyone can easily support others, or easily be able to live better.

## How we built it
We built it multiple different ways, we built a react app, but because of issues we later ditched it and moved to our ASP.NET core app.

## Challenges we ran into
The biggest challenge we ran into is that we are in many different time zones(CT, CAT, IST), and it was really hard to get a good amount of time for us to work together. Another challenge was that we still had our lives going on, and had to tend to other things, and therefore were not able to devote all of our time to this hackathon(which we would have liked to). With coding, The biggest issue was connecting our front-end and back-end, and we haven't really found an answer to that. Another funny issue was that when typing this out, we forgot to hit save and continue so we had to rewrite this, but it wasnâ€™t too bad and cost us only around 20 minutes.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of our idea and prototype, and we got the backend done and the frontend mostly done(just needs wiring), but sadly we were not able to figure out how to integrate ReactJS with ASP.NET. Also, we are proud of the amazing things that we managed to learn over the course of this Hackathon!
## What we learned
Over the course of this hackathon, all of us learned A LOT! We learned how to work in a team globally, and how to push others to be better(even though some of us were thousands of miles away). We also learned a lot of interesting stuff from our workshops, and we were able to implement some of the things that we learned(the react workshop made our front-end better, our program looked better thanks to the workshops from Vercel and Sarthak. The other workshops(such as the Inspirit AI, workshop, the Minion Animation one, the construct workshop, the DeepAI, and many others), taught us a lot, and we are planning to use that knowledge for projects in the future, but unfortunately we could not find a way to implement our newly acquired knowledge from those workshops to our project.

## What's next for Supplies And Demand
We will definitely need to finish this later, after, we want to install a device in the main water supplies to track where water is wasted the most, add the data to a database, suggest best ways to save water and lastly, estimation of monthly wastage and savings of water. If this goes big, we will add free shipping, so our company can ship supplies.
